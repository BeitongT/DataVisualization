<p>This is the second question in homework1. For a, the error is that the name should have quotation marks. The wrong one is { name: "Data-driven web applications" } . And the fixed one is {"name":"Data-driven web applications"} . For b, the error is that the comment should be put outside. The wrong one is { /* the next variable is a course number */ "number": 3300 } . And the fixed one is /* the next variable is a course number */ {"number": 3300 }. For c, the error is that the right square bracket is missed and the symbol after "number" should be semicolon. The wrong one is [ { "name": "DDWA", "number": 3300 } { "name": "Java",
"number": 2110 } { "name": "Python", "number"; 1110 } and the fixed one is [{ "name": "DDWA", "number": 3300 },{ "name": "Java","number": 2110}, { "name": "Python", "number": 1110 }]. The JSON.parse test results are shown in the console.
<script type="text/javascript">
// a. { name: "Data-driven web applications" }

// name should have quotation marks
	obj1 = JSON.parse('{"name":"Data-driven web applications"}');
	// obj1 = {name:"Data-driven web applications"};

	console.log(obj1);
	console.log(obj1.name);

// b. { /* the next variable is a course number */ "number": 3300 }

// comment should be put outside
	/* the next variable is a course number */
	obj2 = JSON.parse('{"number": 3300 }');
	console.log(obj2);
	console.log(obj2.number);

// c. [ { "name": "DDWA", "number": 3300 } { "name": "Java",
// "number": 2110 } { "name": "Python", "number"; 1110 }

// right Square bracketï¼› semicolon;
	obj3 = JSON.parse('[{ "name": "DDWA", "number": 3300 },{ "name": "Java","number": 2110}, { "name": "Python", "number": 1110 }]');
	console.log(obj3);
